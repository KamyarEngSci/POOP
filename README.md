# My GitHub Exercise and Project Journal

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'll be documenting all my exercises and projects as I embark on my programming journey. This is my first repository on GitHub, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## About This Project: Examples of POOP

In this initial entry, I'm diving into the world of programming concepts, starting with a lighthearted take on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I call it "POOP" ‚Äì Pythonic Object-Oriented Examples, of course! üòÑ

### What to Expect

- **Folder Structure:** You'll find organized folders for each example.
- **Code Snippets:** I'll provide code snippets to illustrate the concepts.
- **Explanation:** A brief explanation accompanies each example.
- **Learning Together:** Let's learn and grow as programmers together!

## Examples Included

### 1. Classy Cats üê±
Exploring classes and objects with a fun example involving cats.

### 2. Inheritance Playground üèûÔ∏è
Discovering how inheritance can simplify code using an example of vehicles.

### 3. Encapsulation Puzzle üß©
Unpacking the concept of encapsulation through a puzzle-solving scenario.

### 4. Polymorphism Parade üé≠
Join the polymorphism parade with a lively example involving shapes.

### 5. and more...

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the folders to find each example.
